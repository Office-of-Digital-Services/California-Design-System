		<h2>Respecting diversity</h2>
		<h3>People come first</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Focus on the individual</strong>: Put the person before the condition or identity when discussing
				disabilities or differences.
				For example, say "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person".
			</li>
			<li><strong>Emphasize humanity</strong>: Prioritize the person's humanity over their condition or identity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Gender-neutral cotent</h3>
		<ca-grid>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Pronouns</h4>
				<p>Avoid assuming gender and use "they/them" or other gender-neutral alternatives instead of "he/she".</p>
			</ca-card>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Gendered terms</h4>
				<p>Replace gender-specific job titles like "repairman" with gender-neutral options like "repair person".</p>
			</ca-card>
		</ca-grid>
		<h3>Cultural sensitivity</h3>
		<p>Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid using slang and language that is offensive or hurtful.</p>

		<h2>Clear, consistent, concise</h2>
		<h3>Plain language</h3>
		<p>Use clear, concise language that's easily understood, avoiding jargon, idioms, and slang as mentioned previously.
		</p>
		<h3>Avoid complex sentences</h3>
		<p>According to multiple <a
				href="https://www.evergreen.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/compoundcomplex.pdf">accredited sources</a>, "A
			complex sentence combines an independent clause (a complete thought) with at
			least one dependent clause (a clause that
			cannot stand alone as a sentence)."</p>
		<p>Check out some examples:</p>
