<h1>Eureka Design System UI-kit</h1>
<p>Our UI kit is built to accompany the Eureka Design System and allow designers and developers alike to rapidly
	prototype
	websites using our building blocks.
	The current version of the UI kit is built in Figma, leveraging their components, variants and variables. We offer a
	variety of options for those new to Figma, with:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pre-built patterns and templates.</li>
	<li>The ability to use our kit as a guideline to start you on your creative path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New to Figma?</h2>
<p>Figma makes it easy for you to learn basic functionality and get building quickly. Once you’re comfortable with
	Figma, we’ll guide you through using our UI kit directly in the kit. We have simple
	guidelines and hints to help you use the kit to its full potential.
