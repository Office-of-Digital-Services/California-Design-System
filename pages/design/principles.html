<h1>Principles</h1>
<p>These are our guiding principles for creating positive and engaging user experiences.</p>

		<h2>1. Start with people’s needs</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Prioritize accessibly</strong> – make your services accessible for all Californians. Think about
				people
				who have been
				traditionally excluded, like people who use screen readers or reside in low bandwidth regions.
				<ul>
					<li>All production-level components are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility
							Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2</a> compliant.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><a
					href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/"><strong>Inclusivity</strong></a>
				– design your website so that it is welcoming and usable to all your users.</li>
			<li><strong>Research</strong> - use research and analytics to understand how people use your site and services.
				This
				keeps us focused on
				their needs, not preconceived solutions.</li>
		</ul>
	</ca-card>
	<ca-card>
		<h2>2. Design with purpose and data</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Purpose</strong> – start with problems not solutions.</li>
			<li><strong>Goals</strong> - design towards needs, goals, and success criteria.</li>
			<li><strong>Build from feedback and case studies</strong> – conduct surveys, interviews, and usability studies to
				gain
				valuable insights on
				how people interact with your site and services. Use the data collected to design for their needs.</li>
			<li><strong>Data</strong> - use data to find and evaluate real problems. Ask people what problems they are having.
				Utilize page feedback to
				collect pain points. Understand real problems before coming up with solutions.</li>
		</ul>
	</ca-card>

		<h2>3. Do the hard work to make it simple</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Standardize code</strong> – we’re using the <a
					href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology">TAC methodology</a> to standardize our
				code
				development. Use a methodology that fits
				your organizational needs.</li>
			<li><strong>Performance optimization</strong> - not every Californian has a high-end device. When you build
				services
				and products, think
				about people on a range of devices and internet speeds. To improve optimization, we’re:
				<ul>
					<li>Removing Bootstrap dependencies.</li>
					<li>Utilizing HTML/CSS data attributes.</li>
					<li>Utilizing <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a> web optimization
						scores.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Scalable processes</strong> – processes that scale across time and technologies help maintain your
				system.
				We’ve
				implemented
				the following processes to help maintain our system.
				<ul>
					<li>Design review.</li>
					<li>Content development.</li>
					<li>Code and accessibility review.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>4. Be consistent and concise</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://innovation.ca.gov/blog/posts/why-we-use-content-design/"><strong>Consistent
						experiences</strong></a> make engagement easier across different services and products.</li>
			<li><strong>Succinct content</strong> makes sure important information stands out and is understood.</li>
		</ul>
	</ca-card>
	<ca-card>
		<h2>5. Make it adoptable</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Open-source code</strong> – our <a href="https://github.com/cagov/design-system">Design System
					code</a>
				is open-source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. This means anyone can
				understand how
				it's built, suggest improvements, or adapt it for their own purposes.</li>
			<li><strong>Third-party dependencies</strong> – we’ve removed third-party dependencies to ensure wider adoption,
				such as:
				<ul>
					<li>Bootstrap</li>
					<li>Unnecessary JQuery libraries?</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Simple base code</strong> – we start with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, to give the Design System
				a
				simple
				foundation to
				make it easier to scale across more frameworks.</li>
		</ul>
