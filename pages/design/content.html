	<h1>Content</h1>
	<p>When redesigning or creating a new website, always start with content. Content will help inform design decisions.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Content principles (including readability / plain language guidelines).
			<ul>
				<li>General body content line length. Exception: Cards (link to cards). </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>How to create good content.
			<ul>
				<li>Content audit.</li>
				<li>Information architecture.</li>
				<li>Content standards and priciples.</li>
				<li>How content informs design.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Focus on user needs and services</h2>
	<p>People come to a government website to do something. This could be completing a transaction or learning what they
		need
		to do. If they cannot perform their task, people can feel stuck.</p>
	<p>People expect digital interactions in their lives, including their government interactions. It’s our job to meet
		this
		expectation.</p>
	<h3>Do this in your writing</h3>
	<p>When writing, ask yourself questions like:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How will someone use this information to take action?</li>
		<li>What do they need to do on this page?</li>
		<li>Have you given them enough information to complete their task?
			<ul>
				<li>“We just want people to know this” is not a good reason to include content.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ca-grid>
		<section type="card">
			<h4>Ensure content addresses user need</h4>
			<p>Make the top user needs central in your writing, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using language familiar to the user. Do not prioritize the names
					of your program or people.</li>
				<li>Talk about the services and benefits available today. People are most interested in the current state.
					<ul>
						<li>People are not interested in how we got here or what’s coming.</li>
						<li>Do not apologize for the limits of a program.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section type="card">
			<h4>Encourage stakeholders</h4>
			<p>Focus content on requirements instead of recommendations by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use <strong>must</strong> when telling people what they need to do.</li>
				<li>Use <strong>should</strong> as little as possible and only for recommendations.</li>
				<li>When stakeholders want to use <strong>should</strong>, ask them if people have to do something or if it’s a
					suggestion.</li>
				<li>Learn more about how to write about requirements at <a
						href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/conversational/use-must-to-indicate-requirements/">plainlanguage.gov</a>.
				</li>

	<h2>Meet your audience where they are</h2>
	<ca-grid>
		<section type="card">
			<h3>Why this is important</h3>
			<p>When you write with your audience in mind, your content is more likely to be useful to them. Content designed
				with
				an
				audience in mind makes people feel like they’re heard and understood.</p>
			<p>When content meets an audience where they are, it reduces the struggle to complete tasks. The audience’s
				cognitive
				burden is lower and they’re more pleased with their experience.</p>
			<p>Meeting the audience where they are shifts the burden of understanding processes from the user back to the
				government,
				where it belongs. It puts the “serve” back in “services.”</p>
		</section>
		<section type="card">
			<h3>Do this in your writing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do people come to this content as part of a larger process? Processes can span multiple agencies.</li>
				<li>What friction points exist in the process? Highlight how to work through them if you cannot solve them.</li>
				<li>Does your audience have concerns that would block them from using your service? Address them.</li>
			</ul>

	<!-- <p>Do not assume you know everything about your audience and what they need. Work with user researchers to understand
	who
	your users are and how well they can complete tasks on your website. You may discover audiences and needs you do not
	know about.</p>
<p>If possible, test your content with your audience before publishing it. Even if you only talk to one or two people,
	you
	can learn things you can use to improve your content.</p>
<p>You cannot cover every situation or fix every aspect of a service. Focus on what you can do with content to make
	things
	better.</p>-->
	<h3>Google analytics</h3>
	<p>Google Analytics tracks user behavior on websites. It’s an easy way to learn about your audience and how well
		you’re
		meeting their needs. Performing full user research is important, but Google Analytics can answer a lot of questions
		without having to interview people.</p>
	<p>Talk with your web engineers about enabling Google Analytics on your website.</p>
