		<h2>Respecting diversity</h2>
		<h3>People come first</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Focus on the individual</strong>: Put the person before the condition or identity when discussing
				disabilities or differences.
				For example, say "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person".
			</li>
			<li><strong>Emphasize humanity</strong>: Prioritize the person's humanity over their condition or identity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Gender-neutral cotent</h3>
		<ca-grid>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Pronouns</h4>
				<p>Avoid assuming gender and use "they/them" or other gender-neutral alternatives instead of "he/she".</p>
			</ca-card>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Gendered terms</h4>
				<p>Replace gender-specific job titles like "repairman" with gender-neutral options like "repair person".</p>
			</ca-card>
		</ca-grid>
		<h3>Cultural sensitivity</h3>
		<p>Be mindful of cultural differences and avoid using slang and language that is offensive or hurtful. Here are
			examples of common terms to aviod and those we should consider instead.</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th scope="col">Consider</th>
					<th scope="col">Avoid</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">"people of color" or "communities of color"</td>
					<td>"Minority"</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">"Asian," "person who's black," or "Latino(a)" if preferred.</td>
					<td>"Oriental," "Blacks," or "Hispanics"</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">"How are you? or "How are you doing today?" (Global English)</td>
					<td>"Sup?" or "What's up?" (English slang)</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<h2>Clear, consistent, concise</h2>
		<h3>Plain language</h3>
		<p>Use clear, concise language that's easily understood, avoiding jargon, idioms, and slang as mentioned previously.
		</p>
		<p>For more on plain language, visit the <a href="https://centerforplainlanguage.org/">Center for PLain
				Language</a>.</p>
		<h3>Avoid complex sentences</h3>
		<p>According to multiple <a
				href="https://www.evergreen.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/compoundcomplex.pdf">accredited sources</a>, "A
			complex sentence combines an independent clause (a complete thought) with at
			least one dependent clause (a clause that
			cannot stand alone as a sentence)."</p>
		<p>Check out some examples:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th scope="col">Complex sentence</th>
					<th scope="col">Independent clause</th>
					<th scope="col">Dependent clause</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">Although he was tired, he finished the project.</td>
					<td>"Although he was tired,"</td>
					<td>"he finished the project."</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">When the bell rings, we will have to go to our next class.</td>
					<td>"When the bell rings,"</td>
					<td>"we will have to go to our next class."</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td scope="row">The cat, which was wearing a collar, was very calm.</td>
					<td>"The cat, ..., was very calm."</td>
					<td>", which was wearing a collar,"</td>
				</tr>

		<h3>Accessible font sizes</h3>
		<p>It's important to use accessible font sizes to ensure as many users as possible have access to your content.</p>
		<ca-grid>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Minimum accessible font size</h4>
				<p>Generally, <code>12pt (16px)</code> is <strong>recommended</strong> for body text by most accessiblity
					experts, like <a href="https://accessiblyapp.com/web-accessibility/font-size/">Accessibily</a>.</p>
				<p>Text any smaller than this may be illegible on many platforms, which can create additional accessibility
					issues.</p>
			</ca-card>
			<ca-card>
				<h4>Our recommendation</h4>
				<p>We use and suggest <code>1.125rem (18px)</code> for body text. We want to ensure we deliver what we believe
					to be the most
					accessible product we can to our users.</p>
				<p>Visit our <a href="/pages/digital-design/typography">Typography</a> page for more about our font-sizes and
					type ramp.</p>
