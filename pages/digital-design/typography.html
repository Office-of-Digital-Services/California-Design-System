  <h1>Typography</h1>
  <p>
    Typography refers to the art and technique of arranging and
    designing type, which includes selecting typefaces, arranging
    typefaces, and organizing them in a visually pleasing and
    effective manner. It involves the creation and arrangement of
    letters, numbers, icons, and other characters to form written
    communication, whether in print or digital form.

  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>
    Typography encompasses various elements such as typefaces, fonts,
    point sizes, line spacing, letter spacing, and alignment. These
    elements are used to create hierarchy, readability, and aesthetic
    appeal in written communication. Typography plays a crucial role
    in enhancing the readability and legibility of text, conveying
    meaning and tone, and evoking emotions.
  </p>
  <h2>Typefaces</h2>
  <p>
    Typefaces, also known as fonts, are designed sets of characters
    with consistent visual characteristics. They can range from
    traditional serif typefaces to more modern sans-serif or
    decorative typefaces. Each typeface has its own personality and
    conveys a different mood or message. Typeface selection is an
    important aspect of typography as it helps establish the overall
    tone and visual style of the text.
  </p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Typography is utilized in various mediums such as books,
    magazines, newspapers, posters, websites, advertisements, user
    interfaces, and more. It involves careful consideration of factors
    like readability, legibility, alignment, spacing, and contrast to
    ensure that the text is clear, engaging, and visually appealing to
    the intended audience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, typography is a powerful design tool that combines
    artistic creativity with practical functionality to effectively
    communicate through written language.

  <h3>Blockquote</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks all
      over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to
      rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the
      end of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he
      desisted.
    </p>
