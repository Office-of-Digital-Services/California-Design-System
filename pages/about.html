	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>It can be challenging to connect government services to Californians who need them most. We must consider a wide
		range
		of experiences, abilities, education, and technical literacy.</p>
</ca-container>
<ca-container>
	<p>The California Design System empowers California state government to develop accessible, equitable, and inclusive
		digital
		products and services. Our mission is to help make digital information and services easier to use, by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Removing third-party dependencies that hamper system performance and scalability.</li>
		<li>Using <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and <code>Vanilla JavaScript (JS)</code> to build static web content.
		</li>
		<li>Streamlined Information Architecture for better search engine optimization.</li>
		<li>Seamless updates that allow you to import the new core <code>CSS</code> and <code>JS</code> files for style and
			functionality.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Problems we want to solve</h2>
	<p>Users’ needs drive our work. Responsive to these user needs and challenges, we’ve identified how the Design System
		addresses them.</p>

			<h3>Government websites feel old</h3>
			<p>Why is it that government websites are so horrible? Most are not even using current web technology and are
				nowhere near
				user-friendly.</p>
			<p>Design systems are now a common web development strategy. The Design System will update state web experiences
				to make
				them more uniform and modern. We can update components individually as new best practices emerge.</p>

			<h3>One size does not fit all</h3>
			<p>It can be challenging to connect government services to Californians who need them most. We must consider a
				wide range
				of experiences, abilities, education, and technical literacy.</p>
			<p>State websites vary in quality. Most teams cannot consider the full range of people in a state as large and
				diverse as
				California. The Design System draws on the work of many teams. This lets us adopt solutions that serve everyone
				better.</p>

			<h3>Departments outsourcing web development</h3>
			<p>State agencies are required to use outside contractors rather than being able to hire in-house developers.
				The
				contractors were universally of poor quality and were selected according to criteria of absolutely no
				relevance to
				departmental priorities. And worst of all, it cost far more than it would have cost to hire good people and do
				it
				themselves.</p>
			<p>The Design System lets state digital teams help themselves. Because it is a collection of components, they can
				launch as
				many or as few as they want. Teams can get a full website right away or only the pieces they need.</p>
		</ca-card>
		<ca-card>
			<h3>Lack of consistency</h3>
			<p>State websites have no uniformity or standards. This makes it hard to get agencies to talk and efficiently
				communicate.
				Imagine doing that for the purposes of a small website—Not gonna happen. Each individual one looks horribly
				different in
				its own way.</p>
			<p>By providing a common set of components, Design System sites will feel more uniform. Standards are built into
				the
				components. This gives teams using the Design System the benefit of standards without having to consciously
				integrate
				them in their work.</p>
