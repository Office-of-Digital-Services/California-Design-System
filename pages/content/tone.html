		<p>The tone of your content is important becuase it impacts how users feel about your brand, like it's
			friendliness or trustworthiness.</p>

		<h2>Know the audience</h2>
		<p>As government organizations we must speak to the citizens of California. We have a very diverse population and we
			need to take that into account in our writing.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A tone that resonates with the audience can increase their engagement and trust, leading to higher conversion
				rates.</li>
			<li>By understanding your target audience, you can tailor your tone to effectively communicate with them. For
				example:
				<ul>
					<li>Using a firendlier tone on government sites makes the user feel at ease about tasks they must complete on
						your site.</li>
					<li>Sepaking to our users as if we're right in front of them. It creates a level of respect and empathy.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Consistent</h2>
		<p>According to Kate Moran's article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tone-of-voice-dimensions/">The Four
				Dimensions of Tone of Voice</a>
			, "<strong>Tone of voice</strong> refers to the authorâ€™s feelings
			towards the subject, as expressed through the writing itself."</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A consistent tone across your website boosts the brand's personality and values, making it a memorable user
				experience.</li>
			<li>Consistency throughout helps users quickly understand what your brand stands for and if it aligns with their
				own
				values.</li>
		</ul>
